# monster-slayer-project
This is the OFFICIAL monster slayer project for the assignment in RIA

5 Ways in how i adjusted the code apart from max's

1. I changed the name from "you" to "hero"
2. I adjusted the heal factor to have the same function as "damage" to make it random and fair. It makes the gameplay a little more interesing. 
3. I adjusted some of the special attack and heal so that it was a little more fair.
4. I moved the "start new game" and "battle options" to the top. It looked better to me.
5. I gave the health bars a radius to look more interesting.
